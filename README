What is a CRUD cycle?

The CRUD cycle describes the elemental functions of a persistent database.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.  These functions are also descriptive of the data life cycle.

Different users may have different CRUD cycles based upon the requirements of the system.
A customer for instance might have the ability to create an account, retrieve it and upon return to a website,
update billing information or delete it if necessary.

What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  It is a standardised programming language used for managing relational databases
and performing various operations on the data in them. The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures,
adding updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing
and analytics applications.

-------------------
SQL examples of CRUD:

Create    -      CREATE INDEX ON
Read      -      SELECT FROM
Update    -      UPDATE SET
Delete    -      DELETE FROM
